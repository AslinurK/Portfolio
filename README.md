# Portfolio

I used Freelancer template to create this page. Freelancer is a one page, freelancer portfolio theme built with Bootstrap created by Start Bootstrap. 

The portfolio is featuring 3 examplary homework assignments, an updated resume, an updated Github profile with pinned repositories, and a link to my social media accounts including an updated LinkedIn profile.
